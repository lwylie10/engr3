## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code Snippets
Assignment: Get an RGB LED to cycle through a bunch of colors, but prettily. It should gradually shift colors, cycling through the entire rainbow. We ended up using an example neopixel code from "the complete Adafruit Library" and loading that after changing a few things, such as how fast it goes through the cycle.

```python

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(PIN, NUMPIXELS, brightness=BRIGHTNESS, auto_write=False)\
def rainbow_cycle(wait):
    for color in range(255):
        for pixel in range(len(pixels)):  # pylint: disable=consider-using-enumerate
            pixel_index = (pixel * 256 // len(pixels)) + color * 5
            pixels[pixel] = colorwheel(pixel_index & 255)
        pixels.show()
        time.sleep(wait)
while True:
    rainbow_cycle(SPEED)
```

### Wiring
We literally had no wiring. The neopixel is directly attached to the board, so all we had to do was plug in the board

### Reflection
This was, at first, a confusing assignment. With no prior knowledge of any code of any sort, I was really confused. I spent the first two days just staring at the computer and doing nothing. Finally, I jumped right in. I spent about a whole day just googling up random commands before we got the wise advice to just find an example code. So that is precisely what we did. We used a random code example labeled something along the lines of "neopixel rainbow test" from "the complete Adafruit Library". All that we had to do was press run. It happened to be perfect, all we  had to do was adjust a few  lines of  code and it  ran perfectly.


## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
import time
import board
import pwmio
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
from adafruit_motor import servo

angle=90 #assigning a starting value to my angle variable 

pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D6, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

btn = DigitalInOut(board.D5)#wire in pin D5
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn.pull = Pull.DOWN

btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D4)#wire in pin D4
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT#button is input
btn2.pull = Pull.DOWN#if nothings pressing it it = 0(thats why i dont need a resistor)

while True:
    if  angle<180:
        if btn.value:   #if button 1 is pressed
            print(angle)    #print the angle
            angle = angle+90 #add 90 degrees to the code
            my_servo.angle = angle
            time.sleep(0.02)
    if angle>0:    
            if btn2.value: #same thing as above
               print(angle)
               angle = angle-90
               my_servo.angle = angle
               time.sleep(0.02)


            time.sleep(0.1) # sleep for debounce

```

### Reflection
This assignment was definitly harder then the last one because I had to spend a long time on tweaking the servo values and the different commands to make it less buggy. I had the most trouble with making sure that wherever the servo arm was, when i clicked the button it would move 90 degrees in the direction i wanted it to. it challenged me to think about the way i was coding and what values i had to use to make it less buggy.


## Circuit Python Distance Sensor

### Description & Code Snippets
Use the HC-SR04 to measure the distance to an object and print that out to your serial monitor or LCD in cm.
Next, you will get the neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, and green when its 35cm. For the final version of this code, you'll smoothly shift the color of the onboard neopixel, corresponding to the distance, according to the graphic below.
(Neopixel should stay red when below 5cm and green when above 35cm)
  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
import time
import board
import adafruit_hcsr04
sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D8, echo_pin=board.D7)
import neopixel
from rainbowio import colorwheel
import simpleio

NUMPIXELS = 1
SPEED = 0.05
BRIGHTNESS = 0.1
PIN = board.NEOPIXEL
red=0
blue=0
green=0

cm = 0
pixel = neopixel.NeoPixel(PIN, NUMPIXELS, brightness=0.2, auto_write=False)
while True:
    try:
        cm = sonar.distance  
        if cm >= 0 and cm <=20:
            red = simpleio.map_range(cm, 5, 20, 255, 0)
            blue = simpleio.map_range(cm, 5, 20, 0, 255)
            green = 0
            print(cm)
            pixel.fill((red, green, blue)) 
            pixel.show()      
            time.sleep(0.1)
        elif cm >= 20 and cm <=35: 
            red = 0
            blue = simpleio.map_range(cm, 20, 35, 255, 0)
            green = simpleio.map_range(cm, 20, 35, 0, 255)
            print(cm)
            pixel.fill((red, green, blue))
            pixel.show()
            time.sleep(0.1)
        elif cm > 35 and cm < 120:
            green = 255
            pixel.fill(green)
            red = 0
            blue = 0
            pixel.show
            print (cm)
            time.sleep(0.1)
    except:
        print("i crashed")
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
