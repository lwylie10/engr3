## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code Snippets
Assignment: Get an RGB LED to cycle through a bunch of colors, but prettily. It should gradually shift colors, cycling through the entire rainbow. We ended up using an example neopixel code from "the complete Adafruit Library" and loading that after changing a few things, such as how fast it goes through the cycle.

```python

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(PIN, NUMPIXELS, brightness=BRIGHTNESS, auto_write=False)\
def rainbow_cycle(wait):
    for color in range(255):
        for pixel in range(len(pixels)):  # pylint: disable=consider-using-enumerate
            pixel_index = (pixel * 256 // len(pixels)) + color * 5
            pixels[pixel] = colorwheel(pixel_index & 255)
        pixels.show()
        time.sleep(wait)
while True:
    rainbow_cycle(SPEED)
```

### Wiring
We literally had no wiring. The neopixel is directly attached to the board, so all we had to do was plug in the board

### Reflection
This was, at first, a confusing assignment. With no prior knowledge of any code of any sort, I was really confused. I spent the first two days just staring at the computer and doing nothing. Finally, I jumped right in. I spent about a whole day just googling up random commands before we got the wise advice to just find an example code. So that is precisely what we did. We used a random code example labeled something along the lines of "neopixel rainbow test" from "the complete Adafruit Library". All that we had to do was press run. It happened to be perfect, all we  had to do was adjust a few  lines of  code and it  ran perfectly.

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```

**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**

### Reflection
This assignment was definitly harder then the last one because I had to spend a long time on tweaking the servo values and the different commands to make it less buggy. I had the most trouble with making sure that wherever the servo arm was, when i clicked the button it would move 90 degrees in the direction i wanted it to. it challenged me to think about the way i was coding and what values i had to use to make it less buggy.

Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.


And here is how you should give image credit to someone if you use their work:

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
Then post an image here.   [Here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)


### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**
